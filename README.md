Project is hosted on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/hashit/)

Hashit is an hashing program which can be uses to hash and verify muliple files on a system.
I got the idea from an ubuntu iso image which have this hash table, so i got the idea to make
such a program using python.

In version 1.2.2 i fixed some issues with print and if/else

Works with python2 and python3.
