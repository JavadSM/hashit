Added BSD Style output and check format detection. Also an -s option that can hash a piece of text see [docs](https://github.com/JavadSM/hashit/blob/master/docs/) for more.

The BSD output is specified [here](../docs/README.md)

using -s will take an text input either via the commandline or an prompt that closes on ^D (^Z + ENTER for windows)
we have also added an -A --append option that instead of writing to files, it appends to them
Fixed some bugs and some more documentation.
